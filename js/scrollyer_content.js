'<div class="className">\n\tWe can connect data and story points in three dimensions, all through JavaScript, WebGL, and D3. WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics within modern web browsers regardless of device, without plug-ins. D3 brings data to life with HTML, SVG, and CSS. The potential for enhancing stories, data, and interactivity of web pages is enormous.\n</div>', 
'<div class="className">\n\tWhile some HTML5 effects may seem like eye candy, the opportunity to pair usable, visualized data with enjoyable interactions encourages users to stay on your site, interacting with your content, and then sharing it with their friends and networks.\n</div>',  
'<div class="className">\n\tMap data stored in GIS (geographic information systems) exists independently of a map’s visual manifestation. This enables us to create interesting visualizations of GIS data, such as heat maps, bubble maps, and innumerable varieties of thematic maps that correlate location data with other types of data — climate, economic activity, population density — the list goes on.\n</div>', 
'<div class="className">\n\t360-degree photography and video are far more accessible now than they were just a year or two ago. You can purchase a 360-degree video camera for under $200, enabling inexpensive creation of immersive video environments on a two-dimensional screen with little post-production lift.\n</div>',
'<div class="className">\n\tThe ways HTML5 and libraries like D3 allow us to represent varieties of data are innumerable. Here, we’re clustering data about our nonprofit neighbors by issue area. A simple, playful visualization encourages people to make different connections within a given data set.\n</div>',
'<div class="className">\n\tHTML5 provides us easy, code-light opportunities to add interaction, even if it’s just for the sake of introducing simple interactivity to web pages.\n</div>', 
'<div class="className">\n\tVideo is essential to modern digital storytelling. Create content for real-world environments: projection-map your visuals, film the output, and use your "video of a video" as another mode of content creation for your digital presence.\n</div>', 
'<div class="className">\n\tDevelop designs and environments that optimize your use of high-quality, large-format photography. Free your designs and stories from the captioned rectangle.\n</div>', 
'<div class="className">\n\tVideos and text are linear. D3-based data visualizations allow users to explore, discover, and create their own narrative using multiple dimensions of size, shape, position, sequence, color, and more. \n</div>', 
'<div class="className">\n\tWhat you’ve seen here is just a sample of the many types of interactives we can create to support your digital strategy. The possibilities are almost limitless. Let us know if you’d like to see more — we’re happy to talk about how interactivity could work for you.\n</div>'
