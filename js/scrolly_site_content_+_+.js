'<div class="className">\n\tWe can connect data and story points in three dimensions, all through JavaScript and WebGL. WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics within most modern web browsers regardless of device, without the use of plug-ins. The potential for enhancing stories, data presentations, and overall interactivity of web pages is enormous.\n</div>', 
'<div class="className">\n\tWhile some WebGL effects may look like eye candy, the opportunity to complement usability of visualized data with interactions that are simply enjoyable presents opportunities to encourage users to stay on your site, playing with your content, and ideally, sharing it with their friends and networks.\n</div>',  
'<div class="className">\n\tMap data known as GIS exists independently of a map’s visual manifestation. This enables us to create interesting visualizations of map-based data, such as heat maps, bubble maps, and innumerable varieties of thematic maps that correlate location data with other types of data — climate, species density, economic activity — the list goes on.\n</div>', 
'<div class="className">\n\t360-degree photography and video are far more accessible now than they were just a year or two ago. You can purchase a 360-degree video camera for under $200, enabling you to inexpensively create immersive video environments on a two-dimensional screen with little post-production lift.\n</div>',
'<div class="className">\n\tThe ways HTML5 and WebGL allows us to represent varieties of data are innumerable. Here, we’re simply clustering data about our nonprofit neighbors by issue area. A simple, playful visualization that provides a different take on connections within a given data set.\n</div>',
'<div class="className">\n\tWebGL provides us easy, code-light opportunities to add interaction, even if it’s just for the sake of introducing simple interactivity to web pages.\n</div>', 
'<div class="className">\n\tVideo is essential to modern digital storytelling. Create content for real-world environments: projection-map your visuals, film the output, and use your "video of a video" as another mode of content creation for your digital presence.\n</div>', 
'<div class="className">\n\tDevelop designs and environments that optimize your use of high-quality, large-format photography. Free your designs and stories from the "captioned rectangle."\n</div>', 
'<div class="className">\n\tVideos and text are linear. WebGL-based data visualizations allow users to explore, discover, and create their own stories using multiple dimensions of size, shape, position, sequence, color, and more. \n</div>', 
'<div class="className">\n\tWhat you’ve seen here is just a sample of the many types of interactive we can bring to bear to your digital strategy. The possibilities are almost limitless. Let us know if you’d like to see more — we’re always open for a conversation.\n</div>'
